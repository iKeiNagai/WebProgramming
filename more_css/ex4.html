    [Chorus]
    (Nah) People wanna get close when the money come
    And the beat goes on, "Parara-ram-pam-pam" (Yeah)
    Gimme a second, I need to catch the tempo, tempo
    Gimme a second, I'm caught in the limbo
    People always gather 'round where the fire starts (Fire starts)
    They don't ever wanna help 'til we in the dark (In the dark)
    Gimme a second, I need to catch the tempo, tempo
    Gimme a second, I'm caught in the limbo

    [Verse]
    I used to sleep on a pool table
    Now I got tables that's out by the pool (Yeah)
    Back then thought life was a cruel fable
    Now I realized I just didn't read through (Nah)

    [Chorus]
    People wanna get close when the money come (Money come)
    And the beat goes on, "Parara-ram-pam-pam" (Pam-pam-pam, yeah)
    Gimme a second, I need to catch the tempo, tempo
    Gimme a second, I'm caught in the limbo
    People always gather 'round where the fire starts (Fire starts)
    They don't ever wanna help 'til we in the dark (In the dark)
    Gimme a second, I need to catch the tempo, tempo
    Gimme a second, I'm caught in the limbo
