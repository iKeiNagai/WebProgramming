                <p>"Ditching the cheeky, self-aware wink that helped to exuse the concept's inherent corniness, the movie attempts to look polished and 'cool', but the been-there animation can't compete witht he then-cutting-edge puppetry of the 1990 live-action movie"</p>

                <p>"The turtles themselves may look prettier, but are no smarter; torn irreparably from their countercultural roots, out superheoes on the half shell have been firmly co-opted by the industry their creators once sought to spoof"</p>

                <p>"Impersonally animated and arbitrarily plotted, the story appears to have ben made up as the filmmakers went along."</p>

                <p>"The striking use of image and motion allows each sequence to leave an impression. It's an accomplished restart to this franchise."</p>
