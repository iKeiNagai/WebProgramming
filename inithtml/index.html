    <h1>Formatting text</h1>
    <h2>Paragraphs and lines breaks</h2>
    Users of HTML are sometimes surprised to find that HTML gives them little control over the 
    way that a page is displayed. It should be remembered that HTML was developed as a means 
    of marking up the structure of a document not as a way of determining its presentation. 
    Formatting text to appear on a Web page is therefore different from formatting text to appear 
    in a printed document.
